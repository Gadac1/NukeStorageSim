# Thermal Storage for Sodium-Cooled Fast Neutron Reactors
Python software simulating the use of a thermal storage system to complement a sodium-cooled fast neutron nuclear reactor.

The objective of STORATOM is to be a tool for studying and sizing a molten salt storage system in complement of a complement a sodium-cooled fast neutron nuclear reactor. 

The purpose of this software is to determine the main parameters governing such a system by taking as input an electricity production profile consistent with the situation on the French electricity network at the horizon 2050. It thus measures the impact that such a system would have on the modulation needs of the reactor itself. Indeed, a reactor that produces electricity in a stable manner is immediately more competitive and subject to less aging constraints on its systems.
